## Topic 1

### Exercise 

*Here's a simple exercise with an empty code chunk provided for entering the answer.*

A demo of Rmarkdown syntax: `sum()` or $1+2$ or $$x^2+y^2=z^2$$

Write the R code required to add two plus two:

```{r two-plus-two}
2+2
```

### Shiny Component

```{r, echo=FALSE}
sliderInput("bins", "Number of bins:", min = 1, max = 50, value = 30)
plotOutput("distPlot")
```


```{r, context="server"}
output$distPlot <- renderPlot({
  x <- faithful[, 2]  # Old Faithful Geyser data
  bins <- seq(min(x), max(x), length.out = input$bins + 1)
  hist(x, breaks = bins, col = 'darkgray', border = 'white')
})
```

### Exercise with Code

*Here's an exercise with some prepopulated code as well as `exercise.lines = 5` to provide a bit more initial room to work.*

Now write a function that adds any two numbers and then call it:

```{r add-function, exercise=T, exercise.eval = TRUE,exercise.lines = 6}
add <- function(x,y) {
  return(x+y)
  }
add(2,3)
```

```{r title1, exercise=T}
iris[1:3,]
```


## Topic 2

### Exercise with Hint

*Here's an exercise where the chunk is pre-evaulated via the `exercise.eval` option (so the user can see the default output we'd like them to customize). We also add a "hint" to the correct solution via the chunk immediate below labeled `print-limit-hint`.*



Modify the following code to limit the number of rows printed to 5:

```{r filterdemo, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval=F}
library(dplyr)
# Change the filter to select sepal.length greater than 5
virginica <- filter(iris, Species == "virginica")
virginica
```

```{r filterdemo-solution}
iris2 <- filter(iris, Sepal.Length>5)
iris2
```

```{r filter, exercise=TRUE}
# filter the iris table with either virginica or sepal length greater than 5
head(iris)
```

```{r filter-hint-1}
filter(iris, ...)
```

```{r filter-hint-2}
filter(iris, Species == "virginica")
```

```{r filter-hint-3}
filter(iris, Species == "virginica"| Sepal.Length>5)
```

### Quiz

*You can include any number of single or multiple choice questions as a quiz. Use the `question` function to define a question and the `quiz` function for grouping multiple questions together.*

Some questions to verify that you understand the purposes of various base and recommended R packages:

```{r quiz}
quiz(
  question("Which package contains functions for installing other R packages?",
    answer("base"),
    answer("tools"),
    answer("utils", correct = TRUE),
    answer("codetools")
  ),
  question("Which of the R packages listed below are used to create plots?",
    answer("lattice", correct = TRUE),
    answer("tools"),
    answer("stats"),
    answer("grid", correct = TRUE)
  )
)

```

```{r letter-a1, echo=FALSE}
question("What number is the letter A in the *English* alphabet?",
  answer("8"),
  answer("1", correct = TRUE),
  answer("2", message = "2 is close but it's the letter B rather than A."),
  answer("26")
)
```

Math Quiz:
```{r math, echo=FALSE}
x <- 42
question(sprintf("Suppose $x = %s$. Choose the correct statement:", x),
  answer(sprintf("$\\sqrt{x} = %d$", x + 1)),
  answer(sprintf("$x ^ 2 = %d$", x^2), correct = TRUE),
  answer("$\\sin x = 1$")
)
```


```{r letter-a, echo=FALSE}
question("What number is the letter A in the English alphabet?",
  answer("8"),
  answer("14"),
  answer("1", correct = TRUE),
  answer("23"),
  allow_retry = TRUE
)
```
